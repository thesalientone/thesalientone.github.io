I'm very excited to finally have my first blog post! This was definitely a learning adventure. Using Github Pages is new to me, and Jekyll is definitely a useful technology. I recommend [the Github Pages help page](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) to anyone looking to make a blog or simple static website. The nice thing about Github Pages is the relatively low cost compared to other web hosts.

{% highlight python %}

if blog_post == 'first':
    print("Hello World!")

{% endhighlight %}

I've decided to focus this blog into three main categories: coding, math, and science! I've never really blogged before so I imagine it might take a while before I find a format that I like. I think that I will put a couple of tutorials up.
