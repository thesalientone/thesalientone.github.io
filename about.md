I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for machine learning. I'm currently teaching myself Tensor Flow.
All of the clever machine learning models that people have made to tackle real world problems are really fascinating,
and I enjoy learning about them.

As a child I had the privilege of living in overseas because I was an army brat. One of my favorite places to live
was Germany. The culture was so different and wonderful... and the bread was great too! I was too young to enjoy it at the time,
but I'm told the beer was very tasty as well.

I attended Stuyvesant HS in NYC and Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, FL where studied chemical and biomedical Engineering. Currently, I'm enrolled at Colorado Technical University's online program pursuing a degree in IT with a focus in Systems Software Engineering.

I really like math and my favorite branch of math is [calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus). I love the way math
challenges us to use abstraction to solve real world problems. One of my favorite examples is Euler's solution to the
[Seven Bridges of Königsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_Königsberg). Euler was able to condense the problem into its fundamental form using nodes and edges. He famouly solved the problem and in doing so inadvertently laid the foundation for a new branch of mathematics, [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology).

Right alongside my love for math is passion for physics.  The universe is wonderful, yet so very tricky! Physics allows us to
peer into truths of the world around us. Each generation of scientists builds on the contributions of the previous generation . Gallieo showed us that objects fall to Earth at a constant rate, Newton provided gravity as an explanation, and finally Einstein revealed how gravity is intimately connected to spacetime. What comes next? Will someone discover the graviton?
